  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> Use two or three eggs per omelette. Beat
      the eggs lightly with a whisk or fork.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Melt the butter:</strong> Melt the butter over medium-low heat,
      and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom
      doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add the eggs:</strong> Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a
      heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges
      of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of
      the pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fill the omelette:</strong> Add your toppings and be sure to allow
      everything to cook for a few more seconds
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bon Appétit!:</strong> Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a
      plate with the help of a silicone spatula and enjoy!
